A marriage is concluded when a man and woman, both present at the same time, make a declaration of marriage before the Head of a Public Registry Office. A marriage is also concluded when a man and woman entering into a marriage, subject to the internal regulations of a church or other denominational association, in the presence of a priest, at the same time state their will to get married subject to Polish law. The Head of the Public Registry Office will afterwards draw up a marriage certificate. According to art. 10 1 of the Family and Guardianship Code, marriage cannot be concluded by a person who has not reached 18 years of age. However, for important reasons, the Court of guardians may authorize the marriage a woman who is over sixteen, and of the circumstances appears that the marriage will be in accordance with the best interests of the established families.",
