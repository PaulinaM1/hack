In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2016-2020 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) as well as Africa, Asia and Middle East (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mynamar, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Palestine). Polish development cooperation supports strengthening the rule of law, decentralization reforms and combat against corruption as well as human and civil rights compliance. Its main objectives cover the improvement of health care, better access to education and support for entrepreneurship and agriculture as well as natural environment protection including natural disasters prevention. Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of organisations, such as WHO, also working in the health area. Since 2018, the leading ODA indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there will be no differentiation into net and gross ODA in that respect. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."

They are a set of guidelines, rights and obligations imposed on both the states and the World Health Organization (WHO). International Health Regulations aim at combating and preventing the spread of diseases on an international scale by applying proportionate measures to avoid unnecessary interference with international transport. These regulations regulate the transmission and exchange of information on health hazards between the countries that are party to it and set new standards for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. According to the Article 4 of the International Health Regulations, Poland, as each Member State of the WHO (State Party), designates or establishes the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations. The National Focal Point for International Health Regulations was established at the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. The Chief Sanitary Inspectorate co-operates with the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations, so that they receive information about events that pose public health threats to the international sign. Since 15th of June 2007, all countries that have ratified the WHO Convention, including Poland, are required to comply with the provisions of the International Health Regulations. The quality and level of the following attributes are taken into account in assessing the implementation of the International Health Regulations:  national legislation, policy and financing, coordination and National Focal Point communications, surveillance, response, preparedness, risk communication, human resources, laboratory, points of entry, zoonotic events, food safety, chemical events, radionuclear emergencies.
