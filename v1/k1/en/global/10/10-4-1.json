Wages and salaries concern amounts booked in activity costs for a given period and, therefore, do not include payments from profit and balance surplus in cooperatives. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",
