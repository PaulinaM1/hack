The birth of a child must be reported to the Civil Status Office within 21 days of the date of Birth card compiled by the entity performing therapeutic activity (for a still birth within 3 days). The Birth certificate is compiled by the Civil Status Office at the same day the birth declaration takes place. The birth certificate for the child includes, among other:  name and surname of the child, country, date and place of birth, sex, surname, first and last names, date and place of birth of the parents of the child.  Compiling a Birth certificate for the child allows to give the PESEL number that is necessary for its identification in state registers. Situations when the birth of a child is not reported to the civil status office are treated as crimes, and may involve the case of concealment of the child, i.e. when the birth of a child occurs without the involvement of a medical subject and then the child does not use health services, educational facilities, etc. (what means lack of knowledge of child's existence).",
