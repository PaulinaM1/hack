Intramural expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on R&amp D performed within a statistical unit, whatever the source of funds. They involve both current and capital expenditures linked to R&amp D activities. Current expenditures on R&amp D include personnel costs as well as costs of used materials, non-durable articles and energy, costs of external services (other than R&amp D ) including external processing, transport, renovation, banking, postal, ICT, publishing or municipal services, costs of business trips and other current costs including, in particular, taxes and fees charging costs of activity and profits, property insurance, and equivalents for the benefit of employees – in a part in which they relate to R&amp D . Capital expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on new fixed assets linked to R&amp D and, since 2016, costs of computer hardware used in reasearch and development activities for more than one year (charges for using the product of intellectual property by another entity as well as expenditures on software developed on one's own), costs of purchased patents, long-term licenses or other non-material and legal values that are used in research and development activities for more than one year. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

Researchers (i.e. professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects) constitute the most numerous group of R&D personnel.The group ‘pracownicy naukowo-badawczy’ is a Polish equivalent of the researchers group (presented in Frascati Manual), also named as ‘scientists and engineers’. Belonging into this group requires neither formal qualifications nor occupying a specific post. Full-time equivalents (FTE) are conversion units used to determine actual employment in R&D . One full-time equivalent (FTE) means one person-year devoted exclusively to R&D activities. Employment in R&D in full-time equivalents is calculated on the basis of the ratio of working time devoted to R&D by particular employees within a reporting year to full working time on a particulate position in a given institution. Full-time equivalent is the only measure of employment in R&D used in international comparisons and international publications issued by OECD and EUROSTAT.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2016-2020 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) as well as Africa, Asia and Middle East (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mynamar, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Palestine). Polish development cooperation supports strengthening the rule of law, decentralization reforms and combat against corruption as well as human and civil rights compliance. Its main objectives cover the improvement of health care, better access to education and support for entrepreneurship and agriculture as well as natural environment protection including natural disasters prevention. Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of international organisations also working in the infrastructure area. Since 2018, the indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there is no differentiation into net and gross ODA. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."
