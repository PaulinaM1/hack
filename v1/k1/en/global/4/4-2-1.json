This study covers persons aged 15 and more in households living in the territory of the country. In Poland, children aged 0-14 are also included in the survey. According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) the first question addressed to the respondent in the EHIS survey is self-assessment of health status, i.e. how a person perceives and evaluates his or her own health. In the case of adolescents and adults (aged 15 and over), a response was requested directly from the respondent. For children up to age 15, parents, legal guardians, and relatives may be able to provide information about them. The answer categories used in this question were: very good, good, so so (neither good nor bad), bad and very bad.",
