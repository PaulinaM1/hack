This is the first Polish strategy document, which directly relates to the issue of adaptation to climate change. The aim of the NAS 2020 is to provide sustainable development and the effective functioning of the economy and society in the face of the risks posed by climate changes. The document indicated the priority directions of adaptation actions that should be taken by 2020 in the most sensitive to climate change areas:  water management, agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, health, energy, construction and spatial planning, urban areas, transport, mountain areas and coastal zones.  NAS 2020 is part of a wider research project called KLIMADA, carried out (in years 2011-2013) on the request of the Ministry of the Environment with funds from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, covering the period up to 2070. NAS 2020 strategy is part of the activities of the European Union in terms of adaptation to climate change, which aims to improve the immunity of the Member States on the current and expected climate change, with a focus on better preparation for extreme climatic and weather conditions and the socio-economic costs reduction. Together with the strategy adopted by the Council of Ministers, the special website klimada.mos.gov.pl was launched. It contains information about mitigation and adaptation to climate change.",
