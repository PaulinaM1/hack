In Poland, monitoring of the ICT usage in households in accordance with the EU harmonized methodology was launched in 2004. Since then, the survey has been carried out annually and voluntary participation is ongoing. The study is carried out through face-to face interviews and includes households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people of that age. Two separate questionnaires: for households (SSI-10G) and individuals: (SSI-10I) are used in this survey.
