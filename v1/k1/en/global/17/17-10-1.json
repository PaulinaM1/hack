Statistical value is calculated:  in the case of sales - based on the value of goods on the invoice, in other cases (other than buy / sell transactions), based on the value that would be invoiced.  The statistical value in exports is the value of goods at the place and time at which the goods leave the statistical territory of Poland. The statistical value includes additional costs (e.g. transport costs, transport insurance) for that part of the carriage, which is carried out in the statistical area of Poland. Statistical value in imports is the value of goods at the time and place of their introduction into the Polish statistical territory. The statistical value includes additional costs (eg transport costs, transport insurance) for this part of the carriage outside the Polish statistical area.",
