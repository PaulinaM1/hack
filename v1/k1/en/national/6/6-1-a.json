It is the ability to collect, detent and drain water in a particular place and time on the surface or in the soil, groundwater, vegetation and forest bad. Facilities of small retention of water are buildings and equipment for keeping most of the water in its surface and by-surface circulation. They are: - artificial water reservoirs with a capacity of 5 million cubic meters , - fish ponds , - self-weirs and water intake, - other weirs or transporting water.",
