A climatic correction determines the theoretical value of energy consumption for a given year, assuming that it would be characterised by weather conditions described by a long-term average number of degree days. Kgoe –  kilogram of oil equivalent (contractual), is a unit of measurement of energy used in international balance sheets. It indicates the amount of energy that can be produced from the combustion of one metric kilogram of crude oil. One tonne of oil is equal to the contractual 41.868 GJ or 11.63 MWh. Gross domestic product presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy in a given year. GDP value can be calculated in three ways: - from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products, - from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services, - as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy). Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview technique using 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals.The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat.At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey).Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005.The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household).",

The purpose of the survey is to enable the analysis of the living standards of the population as well as evaluate the impact of various factors on the living standard and its diversity among basic groups of households. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). The household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Expenditures cover expenditures on consumer goods and services as well as other expenditures. Expenditures on consumer goods and services are allocated to satisfying household's needs. They include products purchased by cash, also using debt or credit card, on credit, received free of charge and natural consumption (consumer goods and services taken from individual farm or own economic activity to satisfy household's needs). Consumer goods comprise non-durable goods (e.g. food, beverages or medicines), semi-durable goods (e.g. clothes, books, toys) and durable goods (e.g. cars, washing machines, refrigerators, television sets).Other expenditures include:  - gifts donated to other households and non-commercial institutions;  - certain taxes, such as tax on legacy and donations, tax on real estates, fees for perpetual use of the land;  - prepayments of personal income tax and social security contributions paid directly by the tax payer;  - other kinds of expenditures not allocated directly to consumption, including sums lost in gambling and lotteries, losses of cash and bails.Expenditures on electricity, gas and other fuels were isolated on the basis of COICOP classification.",
