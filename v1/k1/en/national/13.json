Greenhouse gases are components of the Earth's atmosphere, which due to their physicochemical properties have the ability to retain solar energy within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Greenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (NH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for several years to thousands of years. They have an impact on the global climate, regardless of where they are emitted. ",

Base 1990 = 100.The CO2 equivalent unit is one megagram (1 Mg) of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas quantity, representing the equivalent of 1 Mg of carbon dioxide, calculated using the global worming coefficient.The global worming coefficient is an indicator comparing the power of influence of greenhouse gas for the global worming to the power of influence of carbon dioxide; it is calculated on the basis of the influence effect of one kilogram of a given gas for the procces of global warming in the period of 100 years, compared to influence effect of one kilogram of CO2. Global worming coefficients amount to: for carbon dioxide - 1, for methane - 25, for nitrous oxide - 298, for fluorocarbones - from 124 for HFC 152a to 14800 for HFC-23, sulfur hexafluoride - 22800, perfluorocarbones from 7390 for CF4 to 12200 for C2F6, nitrogen trifluoroide - 17200.",

The use of RES significantly reduces the harmful impact of energy on the environment, notably by reducing emissions, especially greenhouse gases. In national conditions energy from renewable sources includes energy from solar radiation, water, wind, geothermal resources and energy generated from solid biofuels, biogas and liquid biofuels as well as ambient energy obtained by heat pumps.
