There are two versions of the index; the first one (WMDT I) was used in the surveys in 2008 and 2010,whereas the second one, introduced in 2013 (WMDT II), is fully adjusted to the purpuse of constantmonitoring of the potential accessibility in terms of its dynamics. Since 2013, WMDT has beencalculated as WMDT II. In each case, the indicator relies on the model of the potential, which isreferred to as 'potential accessibility' in Polish.",
