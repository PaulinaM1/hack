Commercial quality control of agricultural and food products, as well as, their storage and transport conditions is to check whether agricultural and food products meet the specified in the regulations requirements of commercial quality, as well as, additional requirements if the fulfillment has been declared by the producer, and also whether their storage or transport ensure maintaining of the adequate commercial quality.",
