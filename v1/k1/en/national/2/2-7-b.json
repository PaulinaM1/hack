A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). To assess the nutritional status of children in developmental age, tables or centile grids of BMI values based on age are used, separate for boys and girls. According to the current WHO definition: - overweight is a disorder where the value of the BMI is equal to or greater than 85 percentile (&ge;85c) and less than 97 percentile (&lt;97c); - obesity is recognized when the value of the BMI is equal to or greater than the 97 percentile (&ge;97c).",
