The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Lower secondary school educates the youth (aged 13-16) in a three-year cycle programme. Lower secondary education is compulsory. The formal requirement for admission to a lower secondary school is graduation from a primary school.",
