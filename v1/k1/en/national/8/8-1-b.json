                        "methodology": "Innovation activities are all scientific, technological, organisational, financial and commercial steps which actually, or are intended to, lead to the implementation of innovations. Some of these activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include R&D that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation. During a given period, an enterprise’s innovation activities may be of three kinds: successful in having resulted in the implementation of a new innovation; ongoing, work in progress, which has not yet resulted in the implementation of an innovation and abandoned before the implementation of an innovation. Innovation survey is conducted on the basis of international methodology (Oslo Manual). Expenditures incurred on innovation activities in the scope of product and process innovations include expenditures incurred in a given year on: - acquisition of external knowledge in the form of patents, non-patented inventions (solutions), designs, utility and industrial models, licences, disclosures of know-how, trademarks and technical services linked to the implementation of product and process innovations; - acquisition of software linked to the implementation of product and process innovations; - purchases and installment of machinery and technical tools, purchases of means of transport, tools, devices, movables, equipment and expenditures on erection, extension and upgrading of buildings that serve to implement product and process innovations; - training of personnel linked to innovation activities, from a design to marketing stage (both expenditures on purchases of external training and expenditures on internal training); - marketing of new or significantly improved products (expenditures on initial market research, market tests and advertising of new or significantly improved products that are introduced to the market); - research and development (R&D) undertaken to develop new or significantly improved products and processes carried out with the use of own research infrastructure or acquired from other entities; - other preparations to implement product or process innovations (such as feasibility studies, testing and evaluation of new or significantly improved products and processes, standard development and improvement of the software, tooling, engineering and preparatory work). All expenditures on product and process innovations are taken into consideration in an innovation survey, that is, current and capital expenditures incurred within a reporting period on successful (i.e. having resulted in the implementation of an innovation), ongoing and abandoned activities, irrespective of their source of funding. Industrial enterprise is an enterprise that predominant activity was included in the industrial sector according to NACE Rev.2 - PKD 2007 classification, i.e. into one of four sections B: - Mining and quarrying, C – Manufacturing, D – Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply and E - Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities.
