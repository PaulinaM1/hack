Lawns are green areas less than 2 ha, which predominating function is recreation (e.g. there are alleys with benches, playgrounds, etc.). This category also includes green areas near public utility buildings (if made available for public use), monuments, etc., boulevards and promenades and water sports areas, open swimming areas, sport fields, playgrounds, etc., provided they are generally accessible.
