Aiming at elimination of differences in measuring poverty of people living in different countries purchasing power parities (PPP) were used. PPPs are types of currency exchange rates that are used to convert economic indicators expressed in local currencies to a common conventional currency. As the socio-economic realities evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated. The current threshold was set in October 2015. Prior to that, in the 2008 update the World Bank set the international poverty line at $1.25.",
